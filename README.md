WAVES
=====
A Little Cloud Collective project. 

Currently under development by Priyanka Pathak (@priyankacpathak).

Android application that allows users around the world to record 30 second clips of sounds around them, map them to a location, and share them with friends and to the public. WAVES is intended to allow creative expression and collaboration across borders and pave the way for new forms of global exploration and expression.
