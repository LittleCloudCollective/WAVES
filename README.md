WAVES
=====
An Little Cloud Collective project.

Android application that allows users around the world to record 30 second clips of sounds around them, share them with friends and to the public, and download sounds to mix and use for beat making. WAVES is intended to allow creative collaboration across borders and pave the way for new forms of global exploration and expression.
